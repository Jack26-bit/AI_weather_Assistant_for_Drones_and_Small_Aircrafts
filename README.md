   ```

3. **Set up your API key:**
   - Sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your API key to the `.env` file:
     ```
     OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

- `weather <location>` - Get current weather conditions
- `forecast <location>` - Get 5-day weather forecast  
- `multi` - Compare weather at multiple locations
- `alerts` - View active weather alerts
- `history` - Show recent weather queries
- `help` - Show all available commands
- `quit` - Exit the application

### Example Usage

```bash
üõ©Ô∏è  Enter command: weather New York
üõ©Ô∏è  Enter command: forecast London, UK  
üõ©Ô∏è  Enter command: multi
üõ©Ô∏è  Enter command: alerts
```

## Flight Safety Scoring

The system calculates a comprehensive flight safety score (0-100) based on:

- **Wind Conditions (30%)** - Speed, gusts, and direction
- **Visibility (25%)** - Current visibility distance
- **Temperature (15%)** - Battery performance and equipment safety
- **Precipitation (20%)** - Rain and snow conditions
- **Cloud Cover (10%)** - Overall sky conditions

### Safety Levels

- **SAFE (80-100)** ‚úÖ - Ideal conditions for flight
- **CAUTION (60-79)** ‚ö†Ô∏è - Proceed with extra care
- **DANGEROUS (30-59)** ‚ùå - Flight not recommended
- **NO FLY (0-29)** üö´ - Unsafe conditions

## Configuration

Customize safety thresholds in `config.py`:

```python
WIND_SPEED_LIMITS = {
    'safe': 10,      # km/h
    'caution': 20,   # km/h
    'dangerous': 30  # km/h
}

VISIBILITY_LIMITS = {
    'safe': 10,      # km
    'caution': 3,    # km
    'dangerous': 1   # km
}

TEMPERATURE_LIMITS = {
    'min_safe': -10,  # ¬∞C
    'max_safe': 40,   # ¬∞C
}
```

## Weather Alerts

The system automatically monitors for:

- **Wind Alerts** - High wind speeds and gusts
- **Visibility Alerts** - Low visibility conditions
- **Temperature Alerts** - Extreme hot/cold conditions
- **Precipitation Alerts** - Rain and snow warnings
- **Pressure Alerts** - Rapid pressure changes
- **Severe Weather** - Thunderstorms, tornadoes

## Safety Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE**

This tool is designed to assist with flight planning and weather analysis, but should not be the sole source for flight safety decisions. Always:

- Verify weather conditions with multiple sources
- Follow local aviation regulations and guidelines
- Consider your aircraft's specific limitations
- Use proper pre-flight inspection procedures
- Maintain visual observers when required
- Have emergency procedures in place

## API Limits

The free OpenWeatherMap API includes:
- 60 calls per minute
- 1,000 calls per day
- Current weather and 5-day forecast access

For higher usage, consider upgrading to a paid plan.
